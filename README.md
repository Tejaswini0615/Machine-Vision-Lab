EXERCISE1:
1.	Arithmetic operations and Logical operations

Perform Arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) and Logical operations (AND, OR, XOR,NOT) on images (two color and two grey scale images) using open CV and without open CV.

2.	Resizing and Cropping Images
•	Resize the image to half its original dimensions.
•	Resize the image to a specific size (e.g., 200x200 pixels).
•	Crop a portion of the image and save the cropped region.

Image Rotation and Flipping
•	Rotate the image by 90, 180, and 270 degrees.
•	Flip the image horizontally and vertically.

3.	Histogram Analysis
•	Compute and display the histogram for a grayscale image.
•	Compute and display the color histograms (R, G, B) for a color image.
•	Perform histogram equalization to enhance the contrast.
